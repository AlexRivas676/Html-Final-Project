		    <h2 id ="articlestart"> Mexican Culture</h2>
			<p>Mexican culture is very diverse. There are many traditions mexicans follow. 
			Some the tradtions Mexicans follow is quinceaneras,day of the dead(Dia De Los Muertos as it known in spanish), Posadas and much more.
             Mexicans don't only have  traditions but also myths and legends. 
			 Some infamous Mexican legends include La Llorona(weeping woman),Chupacabra(goat sucker), Cucuy(Bogeyman and much more.</p>
			<p> While Quinceanera may seem like a normal birthday parties like a sweet 16, they are very different. 
			Quinceaneras are special parties that celebrate  girls transforming in adulthood when they turn 15 and are very common in Mexico.
			It's very common for people to send thousands on Venues, dresses, and much more for Quinceaneras just a special night. 
			 It's also very common to have special dances for the quinceanera and also for the father of the quince to have a father/daughter dance which is very emotional.</p>
			<p> Dia De Los Muertos is another common Mexican tradtion. 
			Dia De Los Muertos is  a Mexican holiday that is celebrated on November  1st thru November 2nd. 
			On Dia De Los Muertos people gather to throw parties to honor their dead relatives in a way to remember them i n a joyful way. 
			People eat bread called "pan de muerto" which means bread of the dead. People also put makeup on their faces to look like a skull. 
			This tradtion is porttrayed in many movies  such as "Coco" and " The Book of Life".  </p>
			<p> The Legend of  La Llorona goes as follows apparently a woman killed her kids by drowning them in a river and is a ghost that haunts rivers yelling "Ay Mis Hijos"(my kids). 
			She is appparently is said  to be a ghostly figure  who wears a white dress and yelling " Ay Mis Hijos" as i said above in attempt to find her kids as she was denied going to heaven.
			This story is a very common story to tell Mexican childern and strikes fear in many Mexican childern.</p>
			<p> Finally another common myth  in Mexican culture  is Chupacabra. 
			Chupacabra is said to be an unknown species of animal that sucks on animals blood. 
			Because of this it has earned the name Chupacabra which means goat sucker. 
			This Mexican legend scares many farmers who are afraid they might become victim of Chupacabra and this is a very famous legend told around Mexico.  </p>
			<h2 id = "mexican artists" >  Some influential Mexican Music Artists</h2>
			<p> There are many influential people in Mexican Music. 
			However some Artists have inspired and touched  the hearts of the Mexican people like Selena and Vicente Fernandez. 
			There are other Mexican Artists such as Juan Gabriel, Luis Miguel,and Carlos Santana but not as influential as Selena and Vicente Fernandez.
			Just recently Vicente Fernandez passed at the age of 81 and many people even those with no Mexican heritage posted about his death and mourned along with millions of others. 
			Many said there will not be another Vicente Fernadez and many even considered it an end of an era.
			His death brought people together to mourn his death as he inspired many people with his music and he will be deeply missed.
			Selena was another inflential Mexican artists who sadly passed away young just as her career started to boom. 
			She was killed by a crazy fan who Selena trusted who shot her in a hotel. Many people came together to mourn her death and many people still listen to this day.</p>
