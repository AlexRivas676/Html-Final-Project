				    <p>You may be asking yourself why did i pick Mexico as the place for my Final Project. 
					Out of all the places in the world to choose from,why would i pick  Mexico? 
					I chose Mexico because of  the delicious food has to offer,the culture of Mexico,and Mexico is just a beautiful country in general.
                    I am also have Mexican heritage and i think it's important to be proud of your heritage.</p>					
					<h2> Mexican History</h2>
					<p>Mexico has a deep and rich history Some famous  first civilzations of Mexico include the Mayans and Aztecs. 
					The Aztecs were an ancient civilzation that would perform  sacrifices as an offering to the gods they believed. 
					The Aztecs expanded their empire all across Mexico and even founded a city called Tenochtitlan which would be the captial of the Aztec empire. 
					Tenochtitlan  would later become as we know it today as Mexico City and would still be the capital of Mexico. 
					Sadly  the Aztec Empire  would collaspe after the Spanish Conquistadors  conquered  the Aztac empire  and turned it into what we know it as today with a president  ruling over Mexico. 
					Mexico consits of 31 states which include states like Jalisco,Durango with many big cites such as Mexico.  </p>
